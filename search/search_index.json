You can do this by going to <code>Profile &gt; OAuth &gt; OAuth Clients</code> and clicking on <code>Create OAuth Client</code>. Make sure to uncheck the <code>Confidential</code> option.</li> <li>Fill in the <code>Name</code> and <code>Redirect URI</code> fields. The <code>Redirect URL</code> should be set to <code>http://{YOUR_HOST}:{YOUR_PORT}/auth/firefly/callback</code>. For example, if you are running the application on <code>localhost</code> and port <code>3000</code>, the redirect URL would be <code>http://localhost:3000/auth/firefly/callback</code>. This needs to 100% match the URL you are using to access the application.</li> <li>In TrueLayer2Firefly, fill in the <code>API URL</code> with the URL of your Firefly III instance. For example, if you are running Firefly III on <code>localhost</code> and port <code>8080</code>, the API URL would be <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Also fill in the <code>Client ID</code>.

This is a bit more complicated, so follow these steps carefully. You can find more information on the TrueLayer documentation.</p> <ol> <li>Create an application in the TrueLayer dashboard (sign up if you don't have an account yet).</li> <li>Switch your application to <code>Live</code> mode. This is done by clicking on the <code>Switch to Live</code> button in the top right corner of the dashboard. You can confirm if you're in <code>Live</code> mode by checking the the <code>Client ID</code>. This should not start with <code>sandbox-</code>.</li> <li>Find your <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> in the application settings. These can be found in the <code>Settings</code> tab of your application. If you forgot somehow your <code>Client Secret</code>, you can regenerate it in the <code>Settings</code> tab.</li> <li>In the <code>Redirect URI</code> field, fill in the URL of your TrueLayer2Firefly instance. For example, if you are running the application on <code>localhost</code> and port <code>3000</code>, the redirect URL would be <code>http://localhost:3000/auth/truelayer/callback</code>. This needs to 100% match the URL you are using to access the application.</li> <li>In TrueLayer2Firefly, fill in the <code>Client ID</code>,<code>Client Secret</code>, <code>Redirect URI</code> with the values from the TrueLayer dashboard. Again, this needs to 100% match the URL you are using to access the application. You will now be guided through the OAuth flow to authorize the application to access your TrueLayer instance. You can filter per country and then find the banking institutions you want to connect to.</li> <li>From here, follow the instructions in the application to connect your bank accounts.</li> <li>On completion, you will be redirected to the application and your bank accounts will be connected.
