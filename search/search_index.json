You can do this by going to <code>Profile &gt; OAuth &gt; OAuth Clients</code> and clicking on <code>Create OAuth Client</code>. Make sure to uncheck the <code>Confidential</code> option.</li> <li>Fill in the <code>Name</code> and <code>Redirect URI</code> fields. The <code>Redirect URL</code> should be set to <code>http://{YOUR_HOST}:{YOUR_PORT}/auth/firefly/callback</code>. For example, if you are running the application on <code>localhost</code> and port <code>3000</code>, the redirect URL would be <code>http://localhost:3000/auth/firefly/callback</code>.

For example, if you are running Firefly III on <code>localhost</code> and port <code>8080</code>, the API URL would be <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Also fill in the <code>Client ID</code>.

This is done by clicking on the <code>Switch to Live</code> button in the top right corner of the dashboard. You can confirm if you're in <code>Live</code> mode by checking the the <code>Client ID</code>. This should not start with <code>sandbox-</code>.</li> <li>Find your <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> in the application settings. These can be found in the <code>Settings</code> tab of your application.
